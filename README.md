# Code Refactor Starter Code

## Description

This code contains the making of a webpage for Horiseon Social Services.

This webpage is designed to help understand how the internet and business growth can be used together.

I contributed by making the HTML code more organzied and in a semantic order and added "alt" descriptions for the images. 

I, then, went into style.css and reattched the styling with the new semantic order and consolidated the css styling coding.
